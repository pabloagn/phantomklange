## Description

Painted during his stay at the asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, *The Starry Night* is one of Vincent van Gogh's most famous works. It depicts the view from his east-facing window just before sunrise, with the addition of an idealized village. A swirling, turbulent sky filled with luminous stars and a crescent moon dominates the canvas, rendered in thick impasto and dynamic brushstrokes. A towering, flame-like cypress tree anchors the left foreground, often interpreted as a symbol of death and connection between earth and heaven, while the village rests peacefully below.

## Analysis

*The Starry Night* transcends mere landscape painting; it's a powerful expression of van Gogh's inner turmoil and spiritual awe. The swirling energy of the sky contrasts with the tranquility of the village, perhaps reflecting the artist's own turbulent emotions against a backdrop of remembered peace. The painting is a hallmark of Post-Impressionism, prioritizing emotional expression and symbolic color over naturalistic representation. Its enduring power lies in its raw emotional intensity and its depiction of the overwhelming, mystical beauty of the cosmos.
