## Biography

Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky was a Soviet filmmaker, theatre director, writer, and film theorist. He directed only seven feature films between 1962 and 1986: *Ivan's Childhood*, *Andrei Rublev*, *Solaris*, *Mirror*, *Stalker*, *Nostalghia*, and *The Sacrifice*.

His work is characterized by long takes, unconventional dramatic structure, distinctly authored themes, and metaphysical explorations. Tarkovsky's films delve into spirituality, memory, dreams, and the relationship between humanity, nature, and art. He often grappled with censorship from Soviet authorities but remained uncompromising in his artistic vision. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential directors in the history of cinema.
